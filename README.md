tic-tac-tonad
=============

Usage: `runhaskell -XScopedTypeVariables main`

In `main`: Change `getMove` and `getAImove` to change the player for each side. Change `import AIOfastestPlay_notrace` to a different module name to use that AI instead.

The AI is currently very slow for the first 2 moves.
