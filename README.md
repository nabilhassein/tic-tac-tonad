tic-tac-tonad
=============

The main files are `main.hs`, `aio3.hs`, and `utility.hs`. Other files are left to document the progression of the AI code. 

The AI is very slow in the beginning, so it is hard-coded to move in the middle. Remove the `traceShow` instances to remove the "thinking" printouts.

Usage: `runhaskell -XScopedTypeVariables main`
